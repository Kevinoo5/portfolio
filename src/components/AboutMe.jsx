            <h1 className="w-full lg:w-2/5 mx-auto text-xl py-6">Almost three years ago I went to Tartu Vocational College to study to become a software developer and in that time I have learned a lot about everything to do with the life of a developer. I have only worked on one project professionally in that time, but that gave me a lot of experience of the work I would be doing. I am always thinking of how to improve myself and enjoy collaborating with other people, as I like always talking my decisions through with someone and asking for help if I get stuck on a problem.</h1>
