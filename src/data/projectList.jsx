    description: "Wurtle is a simple word guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word of a specific length by entering words of the same length. It is a copy of the popular web game Wordle, but with a few extra features. The game interface is built using the Tkinter library in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a database and provides feedback to the player based on their guesses. I created this project with a classmate to learn about using databases in Python and to practice using the Tkinter library.",
